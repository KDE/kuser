<b>History</b><br>
<p>
Some times ago I had downloaded xusermgr written with XForms. This program has a
great interface but on my 800x600 display it seems very ugly. Some text labels
on the buttons get out of bounds. And so on. Of cause there was a lot of flame
about it. My friend heard it and said : "Why do you flaming? If you don't
like something make better!" I thought that he was right and wrote this
primitive user manager.
</p><br><br>
<b>Usage</b><br>
<p>
KUser is a very simple application. On the main window you can see the
list of the users with full names. When you double click or press Select
button the user preferences dialog will appear. There you can easily modify
all properties such as full name, home directory, login shell, etc.
</p>
<p>
If you are running quota KUser will automaticaly determine it and you will be
also able to modify user quotas. (There might be some bugs here, that's why
please report about something strange.)
</p>
<p>
Also you may add and delete users using either buttons or menu.
</p>
<p>
In this version I add GNU NLS support. And if you want to see all messages
in russian you may say 'export LANG=ru' before you run KUser. Unfortunetly
I don't know well French or German that's why if you wont to see this
messages in your own language you should translate them.
It's simple. In po/ directory there's a file called kuser.pot. 
It's format is simple:
<br>
msgid "English text"<br>
msgstr "Your own language text"
<br>
You should write down there your translation and send me this file.
I'll include it into new distribution. I'll be glad if someone will
continue this.
</p>
<p>
That's all for a moment. I hope that in time this document will be continued.
