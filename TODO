Must do soon (these are very easy):
- Implement UID->SID like in ldapsam (Requires introducing the algorithmic RID base). - Ready
- Newer samba schema support (new attributes in sambaSamAccount in Samba>=3.0.6). - Ready
- Support LDAP entries with more objectclasses than we handle (part of #95366). - Ready for users (lazy to do for groups)

Other:
- Add Kerberos support - Native kerberos protocols or LDAP backed?
  I prefer to add it to the LDAP backend, but first I need to find an 
  LDAP-backed KDC. I heard that Heimdal can do this.
- Filtering users and groups, and implement it in backends, so it would
  be possible to use server-side filtering (mainly in LDAP)
- Find next available UID and RID using LDAP sorting control - need an
  ldap server which implements this control. Also I don't know is this a 
  good idea or not.
- Proper cross-check between user and group SIDs.
- Issue a warning if Unix/Samba account settings are not consistent with
  each other (e.g the group of primary group ID != group of primary group SID).
- Other consistency checks (unique user/group IDs, unique SIDs, etc...).
- Copy data between backends.
- Update docs

And some TODOs from the past which are still unsolved:
- Add 'Help' button to user and group properties dialogs.
- Add right mouse popup
- Replace call of rm with own procedure.
- Use QFile for file operations.
- How about having group name(s) next to the Full name of a user in the upper
  panel, and similarly user names for a group in the lower pannel -- in a
  separate column?
