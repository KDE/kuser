19980328: added #ifdef's to kuser.cpp and kgroup.cpp so that if
	  _KU_FIRST_USER is defined to be, say, 500, then UID's and GID's
	  for regular users start at 500.  If _KU_FIRST_USER is not defined,
	  they start at 1001, the default, as before.   _KU_FIRST_USER can
	  be defined in kdeadmin/config.h.    (This is to make it easy to
	  compile kuser for compatibility with RedHat, where regular users
	  start at UID 500, and the User Private Group scheme is used for
	  GID's.)   <duncan@kde.org>
