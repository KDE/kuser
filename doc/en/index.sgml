<sect>Introduction<label id="sec-Intro">

<p>
Some times ago I had downloaded xusermgr written with XForms. This program has a
great interface but on my 800x600 display it seems very ugly. Some text labels
on the buttons get out of bounds. And so on. Of cause there was a lot of flame
about it. My friend heard it and said : "Why do you flaming? If you don't
like something make better!" I thought that he was right and wrote this
primitive user manager.

<sect>Getting Started<label id="sec-Start">

<p>
This is a short introduction to Kuser. For more detailed info see
<ref id="sec-Using" name="Using Kuser">.

<p>
Actually you are should not do anything to start using Kuser. You may do this
immediately after starting it. All that you want to do is 
<ref id="sec-Cust" name="configuration">.

<sect>Usage<label id="sec-Using">

<sect1>Main Window<label id="sec1-MainWindow">

<p>
Kuser is a very simple application. On the main window you can see two lists:
the list of the users and the list of the groups. To edit user or group you
should simple double click on the it. The user/group properties dialog will
appear.

<sect1>User properties dialog<label id="sec1-UserProps">

<p>
User properties dialog consists of two, three or four tabs.

<p>
It depends on the type of your user storage system and quota presence.
Additional tab will appear if you have shadow passwords, or any other similar
things such as /etc/master.passwd in BSD flavour Unices.

<sect2>User info tab<label id="sec2-userinfo">
<p>
In 'User Info' tab you may modify: Full name, Login shell (the list of login
shells is taken from /etc/shells file), Home directory, extra info, User ID,
Password.

<sect2>Extended info tab<label id="sec2-extended">
<p>
'Extended' tab will appear if you have shadow passwords, or any other similar
things such as /etc/master.passwd in BSD flavour Unices.
There you may modify parameters related to extended account control: Date until
change allowed, Date before change required, Date user will be warned about
expiration, Date before account inactive, Date when account expires, and
Class (on BSD systems).

<sect2>Quota tab<label id="sec2-quota">
<p>
You may see 'Quota' tab only when you have at least one mounted volume with
quota enabled and quota file present. There you may modify all quota related
parameters: File Soft Quota, File Hard Quota, File Time Limit (Grace Period),
iNode Soft Quota, iNode Hard Quota, iNode Time Limit (Grace Period). All
this parameters may be changed for each filesystem, which has user quota
enabled. Filesystems may be changed using 'Quota filesystem' combobox.

<sect2>Groups tab<label id="sec2-group">
<p>
'Groups' tab contains all information about user participation in groups.
First of all it is his primary group. Also you may assign as many as you
like secondary groups using arrow buttons.

<sect1>Group properties<label id="sec1-GroupProps">
<p>
Group properties dialog has two listboxes. The right one contains users,
who is included in the group, and the left one contains the list of
all other users in the system.

<sect1>Adding Users/Groups<label id="sec1-add">
<p>
Also you may add and delete users using either buttons or menu.

<sect>Customizing Kuser<label id="sec-Cust">

<sect1>Edit user creation defaults<label id="sec1-defaults">

<p>
To edit user creation defaults you may use 'Edit defaults' dialog, which
is accessible via menu as File->Preferences. There you may change defaults
used to create new user: Shell, Base of Home Directory (or home directories
volume), either create home directory on create or not, either copy skeleton
to home directory, and use User Private Group mechanism (when creating user,
his own group is created, also when removing user corresponding group removed
also).
