- Add Kerberos support - Native kerberos protocols or LDAP backed?
  I prefer to add it to the LDAP backend, but first I need to find an 
  LDAP-backed KDC. I heard that Heimdal can do this.
- Filtering users and groups, and implement it in backends, so it would
  be possible to use server-side filtering (mainly in LDAP)
- Find next available UID and RID using LDAP sorting control - need an
  ldap server which implements this control
- Update docs

And some TODOs from the past which are still unsolved:
- Add 'Help' button to user and group properties dialogs.
- Add right mouse popup
- Replace call of rm with own procedure.
- Use QFile for file operations.
- How about having group name(s) next to the Full name of a user in the upper
  panel, and similarly user names for a group in the lower pannel -- in a
  separate column?
